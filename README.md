# gameboy_shader_godot

## A simple plug and play shader that will limit the rendering colors to only 4.

 Apply the shader to a color rect and make it cover the viewport. Select the 4 colors you want for your palette and that's it! You have a gameboy looking game. 
This technique is great for 3d or if you don't want to recolor your art but you're going for a gameboy aesthetic.
